            <p class="bodyText">Hi! My name is Jonathan Kaplan and I am an empathy and research driven UX/UI
                designer
                with a focus in user research and usability testing currently living in Atlanta, Georgia. I love
                sushi,
                swimming, and gaming of all kinds, from video games to tabletop-RPGs. I'm currently involved with
                and
                manage an online gaming community of 100+ people located internationally. </p>

            <p class="bodyText"> I have a B.S. in Psychology from Georgia College & State University, with ~3 years
                of cognitive
                psychology and behavioral neuroscience lab experience. In my time at GCSU, I presented
                research at multiple conferences across the South East, was on the board of both the swim club
                and psychology club, and spent the majority of my free-time asleep. </p>

            <p class="bodyText"> I am currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech UX/UI Bootcamp and serve tables on the
                side. I am
                actively looking for UX Research and UX Design positions, and would ideally use my newly
                established skills within the gaming/entertainment industry.</p>

            <p class="bodyText"> Take a look at some of my work below!</p>
